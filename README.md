# Variational Image Captioning Using Deterministic Attention Implementation.

This is the implementation code for the **Variational Image Captioning Using Deterministic Attention** project. The attempt was to generate diverse image descriptions for each input image using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and deterministic attention. 
Our team used beam search for caption generation. Given the same image input and the same beam size input, the model is able to generate different image descriptions.

Some examples:

The first caption is generated by the baseline model. The other captions are generated using our model. Note that our model also generates the baseline caption, but in addition is able to figure out more fine grained and general characteristics of the image for its corresponding description.

#### Note: The baseline model used can be found here: https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning (Traditional Image Captioning with the attention mechanism).
